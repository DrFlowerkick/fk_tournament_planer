// tests/client_registry_adapter_shutdown.rs
//! Shutdown semantics for the single-instance client registry adapter.
//!
//! We verify that when the *last* adapter handle is dropped, active streams
//! end promptly and no zombie tasks remain (observable by quick stream end).
//! Since after the last handle is gone we cannot call methods anymore, the
//! assertion focuses on stream termination behavior.
